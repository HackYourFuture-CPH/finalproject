# Final Project
This repository contains information about the final module of the program, where you will take everything you have learned so far and work together as a team to build a final project together.

This module usually runs for 4-5 weeks.

The final project is organised differently for each team, depending on the team responsible, mentors and the opportunities available at the time. The options could include:
1. Mentor-designed projects and built using [HYF Project Template](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/hyf-project-template)
2. Trainee-proposed projects (e.g. [example project proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11my-sb4T3UziIhjJlYOi60Afxq2dUncE8WYZ8yA-HCY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ik8don4y6sav)) and built using [HYF Project Template](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/hyf-project-template)
3. Client-driven projects designed in collaboration with a real client partner, built using their own template.

## Learning Goals
- [ ] Collaboration in a team setting
  - [ ] Learn to read and extend or improve other peoples code
  - [ ] Learn to give/receive PR feedback
  - [ ] Learn to plan and communicate technical solutions upfront before implementing
- [ ] Develop self-guided learning skills (e.g. learn to read documetation for a framework or API)
- [ ] Interpreting wireframes/prototypes into requirements
- [ ] Breaking bigger problems into smaller written tasks
- [ ] Working in sprints with deadlines
- [ ] Asking for help effectively and at the right time (e.g. describing problems to mentors, asking online, and the power *and* limitations of ChatGPT)
- [ ] Deploying a completed project you are proud to showcase on your portfolio

## Technical Requirements
### Authentication & Authorization
- Team code generation and validation
- Basic access control *- Permissions to restrict user access depending on who they are*
- Session management *- Maintain user state during their use of the app*

### Data Validation
- Input sanitization *- Ensure all user input is cleaned to prevent security vulnerabilities*
- Form validation *- Validate user inputs to make sure they fit any specific criteria you have (e.g. strong passwords)*
- Error handling *- Provide feedback on inputs if something isn't right*

### API Development
- RESTful endpoints *- Implement endpoints that adhere to REST principles*
- Request/response handling *- Handle both making requests and handling their responses sufficiently*
- Error responses *- Handle errors from the API  (e.g. informing the client, updating the UI appropriately)*

### Database Operations
- CRUD operations *- Create, Read, Update and Delete functions to manage your data*
- Relationship handling *- Define and manage appropriate relationships between your data objects*
- Data integrity *- Ensure accuracy and consistency of your data (e.g. constraints, validation)*

### UI/UX Requirements
- Responsive design *- A layout that adapts to different screen sizes*
- Form handling *- User friendly user input and submission flows*
- Loading states *- Visual indicators when content is not fully loaded*
- Error states *- User friendly, actionable feedback when something goes wrong*
- Success feedback *- Positive feedback when things are going to plan*


## Examples of previous final projects
### Team 27 (Aarhus)
They had the opportunity to work with two real clients. So the team was split into two 7 person teams, and worked together on these proposals:
1. Atomic Learning Systems - [Intro](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/finalproject/blob/readme/Example%20projects/Team%2027%20(Aarhus)/Atomic%20Learning%20Systems%20Company%20Document.pdf), [Proposal](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/finalproject/blob/readme/Example%20projects/Team%2027%20(Aarhus)/Final%20project%20guide%20Atomic%20Learning.pdf), [Live demo](https://atomic-learning-systems-hackyourfuture.onrender.com/), [Final code](https://github.com/Atomic-learning-systems/HackYourFuture)
