# Final Project
This repository contains information about the final module of the program, where you will take everything you have learned so far and work together as a team to build a final project together.

This module usually runs for 4-5 weeks.

The final project is organised differently for each team, depending on the team responsible, mentors and the opportunities available at the time for e.g. working with a real client. Find examples of previous final projects below.

### Team 27 (Aarhus)
They had the opportunity to work with two real clients. So the team was split into two 7 person teams, and worked together on these proposals:

Atomic Learning Systems - [Intro](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/finalproject/blob/readme/Example%20projects/Atomic%20Learning%20Systems%20Company%20Document.pdf), [Proposal](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/finalproject/blob/readme/Example%20projects/Final%20project%20guide%20Atomic%20Learning.pdf), [Finished Project](https://atomic-learning-systems-hackyourfuture.onrender.com/)
2. Kazboo - [Intro](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/finalproject/blob/readme/Example%20projects/Kazboo%20Company%20Document.pdf), [Proposal](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/finalproject/blob/readme/Example%20projects/Final%20project%20guide%20Kazboo.pdf), [Finished Project](https://class27-kazboo.onrender.com/)
