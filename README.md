# Final Project
This repository contains information about the final module of the program, where you will take everything you have learned so far and work together as a team to build a final project together.

This module usually runs for 4-5 weeks.

The final project is organised differently for each team, depending on the team responsible, mentors and the opportunities available at the time. The options could include:
1. Mentor-designed projects and built using [HYF Project Template](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/hyf-project-template)
2. Client-driven projects designed in collaboration with a real client partner, built using their own template.

## Learning Goals
- [ ] Collaboration in a team setting
  - [ ] Learn to read and extend or improve other peoples code
  - [ ] Learn to give/receive PR feedback
  - [ ] Learn to plan and communicate technical solutions upfront before implementing
- [ ] Develop self-guided learning skills (e.g. learn to read documetation for a framework or API)
- [ ] Interpreting wireframes/prototypes into requirements
- [ ] Breaking bigger problems into smaller written tasks
- [ ] Working in sprints with deadlines
- [ ] Asking for help effectively and at the right time (e.g. describing problems to mentors, asking online, and the power *and* limitations of ChatGPT)
- [ ] Deploying a completed project you are proud to showcase on your portfolio
