# Final Project
This repository contains information about the final module of the program, where you will take everything you have learned so far and work together as a team to build a final project together.

This module usually runs for 4-5 weeks.

The final project is organised differently for each team, depending on the team responsible, mentors and the opportunities available at the time. The options could include:
1. Mentor-designed projects and built using [HYF Project Template](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/hyf-project-template)
2. Client-driven projects designed in collaboration with a real client partner, built using their own template.

## Examples of previous final projects
### Team 27 (Aarhus)
They had the opportunity to work with two real clients. So the team was split into two 7 person teams, and worked together on these proposals:
1. Atomic Learning Systems - [Intro](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/finalproject/blob/readme/Example%20projects/Team%2027%20(Aarhus)/Atomic%20Learning%20Systems%20Company%20Document.pdf), [Proposal](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/finalproject/blob/readme/Example%20projects/Team%2027%20(Aarhus)/Final%20project%20guide%20Atomic%20Learning.pdf), [Finished Project](https://atomic-learning-systems-hackyourfuture.onrender.com/)
2. Kazboo - [Intro](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/finalproject/blob/readme/Example%20projects/Team%2027%20(Aarhus)/Kazboo%20Company%20Document.pdf), [Proposal](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/finalproject/blob/readme/Example%20projects/Team%2027%20(Aarhus)/Final%20project%20guide%20Kazboo.pdf), [Finished Project](https://class27-kazboo.onrender.com/)
